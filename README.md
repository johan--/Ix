## Problem
Running out of tokens while developing?
Not anymore...


Software systems are too complex to understand.

You read code.
You search logs.
You still guess.

Ix maps your system instead.

AI can’t reason about systems.
LLMs can’t remember them either.

Ix fixes both.

## Demo

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/demo.gif" width="90%" />
</p>

Stop digging through files.
Open the map instead.

Ix improves how AI systems reason about your codebase.

## Results

**30% fewer tokens** on development tasks  
**43% increase in daily LLM usage**  
**Understand systems in minutes, not hours**

Directed context. More signal. Persistent system memory.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ix-infra.com/install.sh | sh
```
### Claude Plugin
``` bash
/plugin marketplace add ix-infrastructure/ix-claude-plugin
/plugin install ix-memory
/reload-plugin
```

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Git installed
- Docker (for full functionality)

## Supported Languages

Ix currently supports:

- TypeScript / JavaScript
- Python
- Go
- Java
- more coming

(See docs for full list)

## Quick Start

Map your system:

```bash
ix map .
```

Understand a component:

```bash
ix explain auth-service
```

Trace a flow:

```bash
ix trace user_login_flow
```

Analyze impact:

```bash
ix impact database.schema
```

Stop guessing. Start navigating.

Map → Explain → Trace → Impact

## Why Ix

Modern systems are not just complex — they're constantly changing.

Every time you switch context, onboard to a new service, or debug a flow, you start from zero.

- knowledge is fragmented across code, logs, and people
- context is lost between sessions
- understanding does not persist

AI doesn’t solve this.
It amplifies it — reasoning is limited to the current prompt, and memory disappears between interactions.

Ix is built to fix this at the system level.

- builds a structured map of your system
- captures relationships and flows
- persists understanding over time
- gives both humans and AI a shared source of truth

Stop re-learning your system.
Start navigating it.

## Use Cases

Ix is most useful for:

- large codebases
- unfamiliar systems
- onboarding new engineers
- debugging complex flows
- improving LLM-assisted development

## The Shift

Ix turns your system into a living map.

Not static diagrams.
Not outdated docs.

A map you can explore.
A map you can trace.
A map that evolves with your system.

With Ix you can:

- Understand architecture instantly
- Trace how anything works
- See impact before making changes
- Debug systems faster
- Build persistent system memory over time

## Built for humans and AI

Developers use Ix to explore and understand systems.

LLMs use Ix as persistent system memory.

Instead of guessing from limited context,
AI can navigate a real system map — with structure, history, and relationships.

The result:

- better reasoning
- more consistent answers
- understanding that compounds over time

## Architecture
<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/arch.png" width="100%"/>
</p>

**How it works:**

1. **Map** — build a system map from code and signals  
2. **Structure** — identify boundaries, flows, and relationships  
3. **Remember** — persist decisions and system knowledge  
4. **Understand** — explore, trace, and analyze with context  

## Core Capabilities

**A living system map**  
Your architecture, always up to date.

**Trace flows instantly**  
Follow how anything moves through your system.

**Understand impact**  
See what changes affect before you make them.

**Persistent system memory**  
Knowledge builds over time.

**AI-assisted reasoning**  
Explore systems with both humans and AI.

## Philosophy

Every complex system should have a map.

Ix gives you yours.

LLMs process. Ix remembers.

Early stage. Rapidly evolving.

If you're building complex systems — we'd love your feedback.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions.

If you’re building with Ix or want to improve it:

- open an issue
- submit a PR
- share feedback

Early stage. Moving fast.

## Status

Ix is in early development (alpha).

APIs and behavior may change.
